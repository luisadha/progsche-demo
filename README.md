progsche is a common but very unique progress bar.
Initially inspired by the DHCP progress bar on their computer.
Aim for entertainment on your desk, a good start to start your hard work :-)

This script is coming for Android built with shell code, my device supports mksh from MirBSD so I don't know if it works or not for others. Just try it! if it works I'm very grateful.

Here are the self-test notes:
1. Testing the Android Terminal Emulator platform
Using ./ Works
Using sh Works (mksh is the same, that versions MIRBSD KSH R43 2013/02/19)
Using bash Work but very fast animations running (bash4.3 that I see)
Using ash Doesn't Work

2. Termux Android platform testing
Untried

3. Testing the GNU/Linux Terminal platform
Untried

4. Testing other platforms.
Untried
